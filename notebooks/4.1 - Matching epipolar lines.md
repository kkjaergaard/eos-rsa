# 4.1 - Matching epipolar lines

**As described in 3.1 - Camera non-calibration,** we see that a point along the epipolar line of point $i$ is described as $r_i = a_i + \lambda (b_i - a_i)$, where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are world-space coordinates of the epipolar line for point $i$.

We are given a set of $i$ points from the frontal image, $g_i = (x_i,y_i,z_i,1)^\top$ where $x_i = 0$ by convention, and a set of $j$ points from the lateral image, $h_j = (x_j,y_j,z_j,1)^\top$ where $y_j = 0$ by convention. The task is to match each point $i$'s epipolar line against the most suitable one from $j$.

We find the distance from any two lines by as

\begin{equation*}
\textrm{dist}(i, j) = \min_{\lambda_i, \lambda_j \in \mathbb{R}}{ \| (a_i + \lambda_i (b_i - a_i)) - (c_j + \lambda_j (d_j - c_j)) \| }
\end{equation*} where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are points on the epipolar line of point $i$ in the frontal image, and $c_i$ and $d_i$ are points on the epipolar line of point $j$ in the lateral image.

The equation above is calculated for any combination of $i$ and $j$, and the lowest combination is found using  [`scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment.html) that uses the Hungarian algorithm, also known as the Munkres or Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.

This associates $n$ lines of $i$ to a line in $j$, where $n$ is the lowest number of lines in $i$Â or $j$. This is not outlier-safe. **TODO: Implement outlier-detection and repeat the association.**

The reconstructed point is considered to lie on the center of the shortest line segment between the associated epipolar lines.
