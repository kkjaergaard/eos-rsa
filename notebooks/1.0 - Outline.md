# 1.0 - Outline

This document outlines the workflow implemented in this RSA software.

## Table of content

1. Outline: Overview of documents and system requirements to view documents.
1. Plane features
    1. Bead center detection: Shows how we find the centers of tantalum beads in EOS x-rays.
1. Camera calibration
    1. Camera non-calibration: Describes how information from DICOM headers is used to calibrate cameras.
1. Point set extraction:
    1. Single projection point lines: Describes how points in one projection are interpolated to lines in space.
    1. Line matching: Describes how we match lines from two projections
1. Point set registration: This shows how point correspondence and transformation is found.

## System requirements

All documents and notebooks should be available in the html folder. To run the notebooks, you need to install Python 3 along with Jupyter, Numpy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Numba.
